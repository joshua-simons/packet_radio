# KD2EGT Packet Radio Experiments!!
Notes and instructions for my packet radio experiments using various hardware, a Kubuntu 20.04 laptop, and a Raspberry Pi 3B+

Scripts folder has scripts and instructions on how to use them. So far I have instructions on how to connect a Mobilinkd TNC3 to the laptop over bluetooth, set up the rfcomm port and ax25 port, and connect to a remote packet bbs.
